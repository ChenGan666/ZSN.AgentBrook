* **Workflow orchestration**: Offers a rich set of feature cards, allowing developers to flexibly define application and agent workflows, meeting various business needs.
* **Plugin management**: Developers can create plugins based on business requirements, providing external perception and manipulation capabilities for large models.
* **System assistant**: Provides example system assistants for developers to reference configurations, quickly building fully-featured AI applications.
* **Development log management**: Facilitates developers in embedding log extraction points, viewing runtime log information, debugging, and monitoring.

**üñ•Ô∏è Deployment Environment**
* Operating Systems: Windows, Linux, Mac

**üì¶ Instructions for Use**
1. **System Deployment**: Choose the release version type according to the deployment environment and run the published files.
2. **System Operation**: After logging in, you can configure and use the functions provided by each module, for example:
    * **Dictionary Management**: Maintain the data dictionary used for system development.
    * **System Menu Management**: Manage the mapping relationships of system menus.
    * **System User Management**: Manage system accounts and permissions.
    * **Model Management**: Configure local or online large models.
    * **Knowledge Base Management**: Upload and process knowledge base files to provide data support for large model Q&A.
    * **Plugin Management**: Develop and manage plugins to provide external capabilities for large models.
    * **Application Management**: Create and manage AI Agent applications, defining application workflows.
    * **Agent Management**: Create and manage agents, defining agent workflows.
    * **System Assistant**: Reference example system assistants to quickly build AI applications.
    * **Development Log Management**: Embed log extraction points, view runtime log information, debug, and monitor.

**üöß Precautions**
* Ensure that the server system version meets the requirements to avoid affecting the user experience.
* When using online large models, be mindful of the call costs and ensure there is sufficient balance.
* The system may experience brief lagging when a large number of data tables are selected; please be patient.
